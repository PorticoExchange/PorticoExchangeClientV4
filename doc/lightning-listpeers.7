NAME
.LP
lightning-listpeers -- Command returning data on connected lightning nodes
.SH
SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBlistpeers\fR [\fIid\fR] [\fIlevel\fR]
.SH
DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlistpeers\fR RPC command returns data on nodes that are connected
or are not connected but have open channels with this node.
.PP
Once a connection to another lightning node has been established, using
the \fBconnect\fR command, data on the node can be returned using
\fBlistpeers\fR and the \fIid\fR that was used with the \fBconnect\fR command.
.PP
If no \fIid\fR is supplied, then data on all lightning nodes that are
connected, or not connected but have open channels with this node, are
returned.
.PP
Supplying \fIid\fR will filter the results to only return data on a node
with a matching \fIid\fR, if one exists.
.PP
Supplying \fIlevel\fR will show log entries related to that peer at the
given log level. Valid log levels are \(dqio\(dq, \(dqdebug\(dq, \(dqinfo\(dq, and
\(dqunusual\(dq.
.PP
If a channel is open with a node and the connection has been lost, then
the node will still appear in the output of the command and the value of
the \fIconnected\fR attribute of the node will be \(dqfalse\(dq.
.PP
The channel will remain open for a set blocktime, after which if the
connection has not been re-established, the channel will close and the
node will no longer appear in the command output.
.SH

This is an \f(BIestimate\fR, which can be wrong because adding HTLCs requires
an increase in fees paid to onchain miners, and onchain fees change
dynamically according to onchain activity.
