<h1 id="lowdown-diffing-engine">Lowdown Diffing Engine</h1>

<p>In this paper, I briefly describe the &#8220;diff&#8221; engine used in
<a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/lowdown.1.html">lowdown-diff(1)</a> tool
in <a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/index.html">lowdown</a>.  The work is
motivated by the need to provide formatted output describing the
difference between two documents&#8212;specifically, formatted PDF via the
<strong>-Tms</strong> output, although <strong>-Thtml</strong> and the other output modes are of
course supported.</p>
<ins>
<p>This documents an early work in progress&#8212;both source code and
documentation.  The source is documented fully in
<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>.
This paper itself is available as
<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.md">diff.md</a>, or downloadable as
<a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/diff.pdf">diff.pdf</a>.

<p>In the new version, <em>new.md</em>, I add some more links and styles.</p>

<p>The most simple way of viewing changes is with the venerable

only reflect changes in the input document&#8212;not the formatted output.</p>

<p>Not very helpful for any but source-level change investigation.  And
given that Markdown doesn&#8217;t encourage the usual &#8220;new sentence, new line&#8221;
of some languages (like <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a>), even
this level of change analysis is difficult: a single change might affect
multiple re-wrapped lines.</p>

<p>A similar possibility is to use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/">wdiff(1)</a>, which produces a set of
word-by-word differences.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">*Lorem* ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do

</code></pre>

<p>One could then extend the Markdown language to accept the insertion and
deletion operations and let the output flow from there.
(In fact, that was my first approach to solving the problem.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, doing so entails extending a language already prone to extension and non-standardisation. <del>Here</del> <del>is</del> <del>some</del> <del>added</del> <del>text.</del> More unfortunately, a word-based diff will not be sensitive to the <del>shmarkdown</del> <ins>Markdown</ins> language itself, and in establishing context-free <del>foo</del> <del>bar</del> <del>baz</del> <ins>sequences</ins> of similar words, will overrun block and span element boundaries.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum are difference tools specific to the
output media.</p>
<ins>
<p>One can directly analyse PDF output using (for example) the
<a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a> tools, which would extract
text, then examine the output with a linear difference engine such as
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-diff-match-patch/">Diff, Match,
Patch</a>.
This is not an optimal solution because, as with the word diff above, it
only compares words and cannot distinguish semantic artefacts such as in
italics, links, code blocks, and so on.</p>
</ins>
<p>There are even more <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HtmlDiff">HTML diff</a> tools
available, so it&#8217;s tempting to use one of these tools to produce an HTML
file consisting of differences, then further use a converter like
<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a> to generate PDFs.</p>

<p>Since the HTML difference engines often respect the structure of HTML,
this is much more optimal in handling semantic difference.  However,
re-structuring the difference does not easily produce a document of the
same style or readability as the PDFs themselves.</p>

<p>The most elegant (and reliable) solution is to attack the problem from
the language-level itself.  Since the
<a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/lowdown.3.html">lowdown(3)</a>
library is able to produce a full parse tree for analysis, it stands to
reason, given the wealth of literature on tree differences (instead of
the usual linear difference, as in the case of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a> and friends), one can work
within the language to produce differences.<del><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></del></p>

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>

<p>The algorithm is in effect an ordered tree diff.  I began with
well-studied algorithms for a well-studied problem: XML tree
differences.  (The HTML difference tools described above inherit from
those algorithms.) For an overview of algorithms, see Change Detection
in XML Trees: a Survey<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.  I base the
<a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/lowdown.1.html">lowdown-diff(1)</a> algorithm off
of Detecting Changes in XML Documents<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The reason for this choice instead of another is primarily the ease in
implementation.  Moreover, since the programmatic output of the
algorithm is a generic AST, it&#8217;s feasible to re-implement the algorithm
in different ways, or augment it at a later date.</p>

<p>The BULD algorithm described in this paper is straightforward.  It
begins with a short sanitisation pass.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Annotate each node in the parse tree with a hash of the subtree
rooted at the node, inclusive.
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>annotate_sigs()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate each node with a weight corresponding to the subtree rooted
at the node.
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>annotate_sigs()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Enqueue the new document&#8217;s root node in a priority queue ordered by
weight. Then, while the priority queue is non-empty:
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>lowdown_diff()</code>)</p>

<ol>
<li>Pop the first node of the priority queue.</li>
<li>Look for candidates in the old document whose hash matches the
popped node&#8217;s hash.
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>candidate()</code>)</li>
<li>Choose an optimal candidate and mark it as matched.
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>optimality()</code>)</li>
<li>If the no candidates were found, enqueue the node&#8217;s children into
the priority queue.</li>
<li>A a candidate was selected, mark all of its subtree nodes as
matching the corresponding nodes in the old tree (&#8220;propogate
down&#8221;), then mark ancestor nodes similarly (&#8220;propogate up&#8221;).
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>match_up()</code>, <code>match_down()</code>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Run an optimisation phase over the new document&#8217;s root node.
(<ins><a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a></ins><del><a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a></del>,
<del><code>node_optimise()</code></del><ins><code>node_optimise_bottomup()</code></ins><ins> and </ins><ins><code>node_optimise_topdown()</code></ins>)</p></li>
<li><p>Step through both trees and create a new tree with nodes cloned from
both and marked as inserted or deleted.
(<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/blob/master/diff.c">diff.c</a>,
<code>node_merge()</code>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My implementation changes or extends the BULD algorithm in several small
ways, described in the per-step documentation below.</p>

<h3 id="sanitise">Sanitise</h3>

<p>Before the BULD algorithm is run, the input tree is sanitised.  This
process merges all adjacent text nodes into a single text node.  By
doing so, possible differences are pushed into large blocks of
contiguous text&#8212;which in this case are managed by the word-difference
algorithm described later in this paper.</p>

<h3 id="annotation">Annotation</h3>

<p>Each node in the tree is annotated with a hash and a weight.  The hash,
MD5, is computed in all data concerning a node.  For example, normal
text nodes (<code>LOWDOWN_NORMAL_TEXT</code>) have the hash produced from the
enclosed text.  Autolinks (<code>LOWDOWN_LINK_AUTO</code>) use the link text, link,
and type.</p>

<p>There are some nodes whose data is not hashed.  For example, list
numbers: since these may change when nodes are moved, the numbers are
not part of the hash.  In general, all volatile information that may be
inferred from the document structure (column number, list item number,
footnote number, etc.) is disregarded.</p>

<p>Non-leaf nodes compute their hashes from the node type and the hashes of
all of their children.  Thus, this step is a bottom-up search.</p>

<p>Node weight is computed exactly as noted in the paper.</p>

<h3 id="optimal-candidacy">Optimal candidacy</h3>

<p>A node&#8217;s candidate in the old tree is one whose hash matches.  In most
documents, there are many candidates for certain types of nodes.
(Usually text nodes.)</p>

<p>Candidate optimality is computed by looking at the number of parent
nodes that match on both sides.  The number of parents to consider is
noted in the next sub-section.  The distance climbed is bounded by the
weight of the sub-tree as defined in the paper.</p>

<p>In the event of similar optimality, the node &#8220;closest&#8221; to the current
node is chosen.  Proximity is defined by the node identifier, which is
its prefix order in the parse tree.</p>

<h3 id="propogate-up">&#8220;Propogate up&#8221;</h3>

<p>When propogating a match upward, the distance upward is bound depending
on the matched sub-tree as defined in the paper.  This makes it so that
&#8220;small&#8221; similarities (such as text) don&#8217;t erroneously match two larger
sub-trees that are otherwise different.  Upward matches occur while the
nodes&#8217; labels are the same, including attributes (e.g., link text).</p>

<p>I did modify the algorithm to propogate upward &#8220;for free&#8221; through
similar singleton nodes, even if it means going beyond the maximum
number allowed by the sub-tree weight.</p>

<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/lowdown.1.html">lowdown-diff(1)</a>
algorithm has two optimisations, both lightly derived from the paper:
top-down and bottom-up propogation.</p>

<h4 id="top-down">Top-down</h4>

<p>The top-down optimisation, which is performed first, takes matched nodes and matches un-matched, non-terminal children by label.<ins>The</ins> <ins>children</ins> <ins>examined</ins> <ins>must</ins> <ins>be</ins> <ins>siblings</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>adjacent</ins> <ins>matching</ins> <ins>nodes.</ins></p>

<p>This is useful when, say, a document consists of several paragraphs
where the text has changed within paragraphs.  It won&#8217;t be able to match
the text content, but it will match the paragraphs, which will push the
difference downward in the tree.</p>

<h4 id="bottom-up">Bottom-up</h4>

<p>In the bottom-up propogation, the weight of any given sub-tree is used
to compute how high a match will propogate.  I extend the paper&#8217;s
version optimisation by looking at the cumulative weight of matching
children.</p>

<p>This works well for Markdown documents, which are generally quite
shallow and text-heavy.</p>

<p>For each unmatched non-terminal node with at least one
matched child, the weights of all matched children with the same parents
(where the parent node is equal in label and attributes to the examined
node) are computed.  If any given parent of the matched children has
greater than 50% of the possible weight, it is matched.</p>

<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>

<p>The merging phase, which is not described in the paper, is very
straightforward.  It uses a recursive merge algorithm starting at the
root node of the new tree and the root node of the old tree.</p>

<ol>
<li>The invariant is that the current node is matched by the corresonding
node in the old tree.</li>
<li>First, step through child nodes in the old tree.  Mark as deleted all
nodes not being matched to the new tree.</li>
<li>Next, step through child nodes in the new tree.  Mark as inserted all
nodes not having a match in the old tree.</li>
<li>Now, starting with the first node in the new tree having a match in
the old tree, search for that match in the list of old tree children.</li>
<li>If found, mark as deleted all previous old tree nodes up until the
match.  Then re-run the merge algorithm starting at the matching
child nodes.</li>
<li>If not found, mark the new node as inserted and return to (2).</li>
<li>Continue (after the recursive step) by moving after both matching
nodes and returning to (2).</li>
</ol>

<p>If adjacent nodes are un-matched normal text, the normal text nodes are
compared word-by-word to compute a shortest-edit script.  This is
enabled by <a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/libdiff">libdiff</a>, which
implements an algorithm for computing the longest common
subsequence<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.  See <sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> for background information.</p>
<ins>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
</ins><ins>
<p>Tables are currently in the &#8220;hacks&#8221; state in that they&#8217;re considered as
opaque bodies.  Tables that have changed in any way are simply deleted
and re-added: there&#8217;s no attempt to discern actual differences.</p>
</ins><ins>
<p>There are ways to reduce this opacity, such as being able to detect and
account for added or removed rows.  However, ultimately there is some
opacity in that changed table headers do not have a representable form
in the output.</p>
</ins><ins>
<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>
</ins><ins>
<p>Like tables, metadata key-value pairs are opaque bodies.  Metadata has a
complex relationship with Markdown documents, which leaves how to handle
the &#8220;difference&#8221; uncertain.</p>
</ins><ins>
<p>The difference engine, after computing differences like any other opaque
nodes, simply passes the difference to front-ends, which determine how
to handle this for themselves.  For front-ends that use the metadata in
creating document headers (e.g., HTML, LaTeX, roff), the policy is not
to process deleted metadata.</p>
</ins><ins>
<p>Thus, metadata won&#8217;t strictly represent the document differences.</p>
</ins><ins>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
</ins><ins>
<p>Footnotes required some consideration because the order in which the
definitions and references are printed must be synchronised.  Now a
process keeps track of all references (added, deleted, unchanged) and
renumbers then.  When references are emitted, these are emitted in the
correct order.</p>
</ins>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>

<p>The result of the algorithm is a new tree marked with insertions and
deletions.  These are specifically noted with the <code>LOWDOWN_CHNG_INSERT</code>
and <code>LOWDOWN_CHNG_DELETE</code> variables.</p>

<p>The algorithm may be run with the <code>lowdown_diff()</code> function, which
produces the merged tree.</p>

<p>A set of convenience functions, <code>lowdown_buf_diff()</code> and
<code>lowdown_file_diff()</code>, also provide this functionality.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>There are many possible improvements to the algorithm.</p>
<del>
<p>Foremost is the issue of normal text nodes.  There should be a process
first that merges consecutive text nodes.  This happens, for example,
when the <code>w</code> character is encountered at any time and might signify a
link.  The parsing algorithm will start a new text node at each such
character. </p>
</del>
<p>The merging algorithm can also take advantage of
<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/libdiff">libdiff</a> when ordering the
output of inserted and deleted components.  Right now, the algorithm is
simple in the sense of stopping at the earliest matched node without
considering subsequences.</p>
<del>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>-Tms</strong> and <strong>-Tman</strong> output needs work to make sure that
the insert&#47;delete macros don&#8217;t disrupt the flow of text.</p>
