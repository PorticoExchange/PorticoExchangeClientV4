\hypertarget{an-h1-header}{%
\section{An h1 header}\label{an-h1-header}}

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. \emph{Italic}, \textbf{bold}, and \texttt{monospace}. Itemized lists
look like:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -0.2em
\item this one
\item that one
\item the other one
\end{itemize}

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

\begin{quotation}

Block quotes are
written like so.

They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.
\end{quotation}

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., ``it's all
in chapters 12--14''). Three dots \ldots{} will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

\hypertarget{an-h2-header}{%
\subsection{An h2 header}\label{an-h2-header}}

Here's a numbered list:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep -0.2em
\item first item
\item second item
\item third item
\end{enumerate}

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

\begin{verbatim}
# Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
\end{verbatim}

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

\begin{verbatim}
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
\end{verbatim}

(which makes copying \& pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

\begin{verbatim}
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{an-h3-header}{%
\subsubsection{An h3 header}\label{an-h3-header}}

Now a nested list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
First, get these ingredients:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -0.2em
\item carrots
\item celery
\item lentils
\end{itemize}
\item 
Boil some water.
\item 
Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:

\begin{verbatim}
find wooden spoon
uncover pot
stir
cover pot
balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
wait 10 minutes
goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
\end{verbatim}

Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.
\end{enumerate}

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to \href{http://foo.bar}{a website}, to a \href{local-doc.html}{local
doc}, and to a \hyperlink{an-h2-header}{section heading in the current
doc}. Here's a footnote \footnote[1]{
Footnote text goes here.
}
.

Tables can look like this:

\begin{longtable}[]{lll}
size & material & color  \\
9 & leather & brown  \\
10 & hemp canvas & natural  \\
11 & glass & transparent  \\
\end{longtable}

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.)

A horizontal rule follows.

\noindent\hrulefill

Here's a definition list:
\begin{description}
\item [apples] Good for making applesauce.
\item [oranges] Citrus!
\item [tomatoes] There's no ``e'' in tomatoe.
\end{description}

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Images can be specified like so:

\includegraphics[]{{example-image}.jpg}

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.
